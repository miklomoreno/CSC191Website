        <h1>Problem</h1>
        <h2> The University Union at California State University, Sacramento requires multiple building supervisors to effectively and efficiently make 
            sure that all parts of the Union are prepared for Sac State's large student population and miscellaneous events. Currently, the communication 
            between these building supervisors and Union management is antiquated and cluttered through the use of paper documents. Building reports and 
            accident reports are currently being handwritten and turned in by supervisors daily at the end of their shift. Our client has asked our team 
            to create an application that will simplify this process and move all created documents into a digital format that's created and stored in a 
            database. </h2>
        <br><br>
        <h1> Solution</h1>
        <h2> We created Building Supervisor Assist, a web based application that can be used on both PC and mobile web browsers that allows users to create and view shift reports. This allows Shift Supervisors to fill out their reports 
            from their phones while they visit each location throughout the building. Each report can be easily filled out throughout a user's shift and easily submitted when they're ready to finalize their report and clock out. Each 
            submitted report is automatically converted into a PDF document that contains the user's name, shift duration, and the details of their report. That document is then automatically sent out as an email to a predefined list 
            of recipients for further review. Managers who use Building Supervisor Assist are also able to create and manage users in order to control who has access to the application. Reports are saved to a database so that users 
            can easily view past reports, search past reports, and download reports as a PDF. Building Supervisor Assist will be deployed to a server that hosts the application on the University Union's local network.
