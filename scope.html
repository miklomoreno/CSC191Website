        <h1> What is the scope of our project?</h1>
        <h2> The current data tracking and entry system is uneconomic, environmentally detrimental, cumbersome, and error prone, as
        it is mostly done by manual paper collection and excel spreadsheets. We believe we can improve
        the current system by implementing streamlined processes for building-status data entry, thereby reducing data clutter,
        physical space clutter, and time spent managing data. We also believe we can improve the recall of historical data by
        creating a digital system that will replace or streamline their current paper entry system and replace the excel
        spreadsheets used for managing said system. This will provide the Administrative Office with more timely updates on building issues as well as the minimization of physical storage of documents and time spent data processing, while increasing the visibility of important and historical data.</h2>

        <h1> How are we going to do this?</h1>
        <h2>bitArchitecture is currently working on a web-application that will integrate with Sacramento State's current infrastructure. This will   require the project to be reviewed and accepted through the HECVAT application process. We will include the use of Sacramento State's SSO and web hosting service. This application will include a user-friendly user interface that includes: <br><ul>
            <li>The ability to quickly create, maintain, and send reports. </li><br>
            <li>An updatable e-mailing list for reports for users to automatically recieve an e-mailed shift report.</li><br>
            <li>User Management</li><br>
        </ul></h2>
