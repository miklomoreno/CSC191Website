        <h1>Sails.js</h1>
        <h2><a href="https://sailsjs.com/">Sails.js</a> is a realtime Model-View-Controller Framework that allowed our team to get development up and running quickly. The framework came with great security options and an Object-relation Mapping Waterline which allowed us to use JSON for development
            and the option to quickly convert to a MySQL database for production. </h2>

        <br><br>
        <h1>Bootstrap</h1>
        <h2> The use of <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> allowed for a quick CSS layout for our web application and reduced the amount of redundant code throughout our project.</h2>

        <br><br>
        <h1>Visual Studio Code</h1>
        <h2> Our team all decided to use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> as our IDE while working on Building Supervisor Assist. As a team, this was the IDE we had the most experience with. VS Code also had some easy to learn, but highly productive extensions and interactions with Git.</h2>

        <br><br>
        <h1> Testing </h1>
        <h2>Our product is currently being tested both automatically and manually using the following technologies: <a href="https://mochajs.org/">Mocha</a>, <a href="https://superset.apache.org/">Superset</a>, <a href="https://istanbul.js.org/">Istanbul</a> ,
            and <a href="https://www.chaijs.com/">Chai</a>. The combination of the Mocha, Supertest, and Istanbul were used to implement and automated testing framework - Mocha as basic assertion library, Supertest for an HTTP assertion library, and Istanbul for code coverage report generation.
            Building Supervisor Assist currently has about 60% coverage from automatic testing.<br><ul>
