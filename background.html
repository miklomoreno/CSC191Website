        <h1>Our Client</h1>
        <h2>Norma Sanchez, is the Assistant Director of Operations at Sacramento States's University Union. </h2>

        <br><br>
        <h1>Their Business</h1>
        <h2> The University Union at California State University Sacramento is a hub where students can hang out, study, relax, or enjoy using any of the many amenities offered to students. The University Union requires Building Supervisors to effectively and efficiently make sure that all parts of the Union are safe and prepared for Sacramento State's large student population and miscellaneous events. </h2>

        <br><br>
        <h1>The Problem</h1>
        <h2> Currently, the communication between these building supervisors and Union management is antiquated and cluttered through the use of paper documents. Building reports and accident reports are currently being handwritten and turned in by supervisors daily at the end of their shift.</h2>

        <br><br>
        <h1> Project Overview</h1>
        <h2>Our team is currently working on mobile/desktop friendly web-application. This application will include a user-friendly interface that would make creating, editing, and uploading reports easier than ever! <br><ul>
