                <h1> This project is being undertaken by the development team bitArchitecture, comprised of undergraduate students majoring
                in Computer Science at California State University, Sacramento. The team members are enrolled in a two-semester senior
                project course required of all undergraduate majors. Successful delivery of the desired software product will fulfill
                the senior project requirement for the student team members.</h1>

        <h1>How is the Union currently supervised?</h1>
        <h2> The University Union at California State University, Sacramento requires multiple building supervisors to effectively and efficiently make sure that all parts of the Union are prepared for Sac State's large student population and miscellaneous events. Currently, the communication between these building supervisors and Union management is antiquated and cluttered through the use of paper documents. Building reports and accident reports are currently being handwritten and turned in by supervisors daily at the end of their shift. These documents are used then archived physically for up to two years for insurance purposes. </h2>
        <br><br>
        <h1> What's the scope of our project?</h1>
        <h2> The current data tracking and entry system is uneconomic, environmentally detrimental, cumbersome, and error prone, as
        it is mostly done by manual paper collection and entering that data into an excel spreadsheet. We believe we can improve
        the current system by implementing streamlined processes for building-status data entry, thereby reducing data clutter,
        physical space clutter, and time spent managing data. We also believe we can improve the recall of historical data by
        creating a digital system that will replace or streamline their current paper entry system and replace the excel
        spreadsheets used for managing said system. This will provide the Administrative Office with confidence in the coverage
        of building monitoring, more timely updates on building issues, and the minimization of physical storage of documents
        and time spent data processing, while increasing the visibility of important and historical data.</h2>
        <br><br>
        <h1> How are we going to do this?</h1>
        <h2>bitArchitecture is currently working on a web-application that will integrate with Sacramento State's current infrastructure. This will require the project to be reviewed and accepted through the HECVAT application process. We will include the use of Sacramento State's SSO and web hosting service. This application will include a user-friendly user interface that includes: <br><ul>
            <li>The ability to quickly create, maintain, and send reports. </li><br>
            <li>An updatable e-mailing list for reports for users to automatically recieve an e-mailed shift report.</li><br>
            <li>User Management</li><br>
        </ul><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></h2><br>
        <h1> When are we deploying? </h1>
        <h2> The team is currently waiting on an official Sacramento State server to deploy our application onto. While traversing the difficulties of multiple department
             communication and meeting security requirements for official deployment, our team has had important hands-on experience that has led to a great amount of knew knowledge.
             As of right now, we hope to have Building Supervisor Assist deployed and ready to use for training by July 2021. </h2>
